I was approached by a Planetar of Justice who shared grim tidings: my name has been inscribed upon the Scroll of Retribution. The faithful of Tyr ask that I share the truth of what happened at Saradush. 

To clear my name I must first travel to Lunia, the Silver Heaven.~

Upon arrival in Lunia another Planetar of Justice welcomed me and sent me to speak with Naiman Alore.~
