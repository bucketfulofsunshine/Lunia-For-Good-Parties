@292  = ~Yaga-Shura destroyed Saradush. The city did not fall by my hand.~
@293  = ~Blame me if you like, but I didn't choose this madness.~
@294  = ~Causation does not prove guilt. I was not present in Saradush, nor did I order its destruction.~
@295  = ~I have nothing more to add.~
@296  = ~A grave error has been made. <CHARNAME> you are, by all accounts, a paragon of virtue. Your name should never have been added to the Scroll.~
@297  = ~Please take this ink and sand - the tools by which names are recorded or erased. Use them to amend the list. I offer my sincerest apologies for this injustice.~
@298  = ~I must report this oversight to my superiors. Such a travesty cannot be repeated. But I urge you to seek out the planetar who first named you. Only then can we learn who is responsible for framing you.~
@299  = ~Fare thee well on the remainder of your quest.~
@300  = ~You have offered your arguments but I am unconvinced. Your name shall remain inscribed unless you offer irrefutable proof.~
@301  = ~Seek out the planetar who first spoke against you. Perhaps, in doing so, you will find clarity.~
@302  = ~Good evening to you, <CHARNAME>. Have you returned with further testimony or evidence?~ [BFLU1]
@303  = ~I found the planetar responsible. I have no concrete proof beyond their confession, but after attacking me, they dropped this gem.~
@304  = ~I'll return later.~
@305  = ~You hold a Tear of the Triad. A gem formed when divine servants act in error or stray from justice. Such a token, when shrouded in shadow, marks Tyr's disapproval.~
@306  = ~But to see one so utterly devoid of light is rare. If this was held by the planetar who named you, then I must accept the error of my own judgment.~
@307  = ~<CHARNAME>, I was wrong to doubt you. Your name does not belong upon the Scroll of Divine Retribution.~
@308  = ~I must report this oversight to my superiors. Such a travesty cannot be repeated.~
@309  = ~Halt! Who would enter the Pavilion of Wrath?~
@310  = ~Identify yourself.~
@311  = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I was sent here to speak with Naiman Alore.~
@312  = ~I am <CHARNAME>, servant of Tyr.~
@313  = ~I am Rodesi Ponz, servant of Tyr.~
@314  = ~Of Righteous Wrath, you mean.~
@315  = ~Stand aside. I've business with the scribe.~
@316  = ~Your name is familiar to me, <CHARNAME>.~
@317  = ~I can't imagine why.~
@318  = ~I wish I could say I'm surprised. Back in the Material Plane, there's a total and complete scoundrel whose name I have the misfortune to share.~
@319  = ~That's fitting, as it's the name of the <PRO_MANWOMAN> who will kill you.~
@320  = ~Ah. That would explain it. You may pass.~
@321  = ~Yes, I recognize it now. At the bidding of one of our planetars, Alore recently inscribed the name in the Scroll of Retribution. Something about siding with a murderous half-oblackguard. And who is this I see beside you...?~
@322  = ~This is Herth Il-Khan, cousin and sworn enemy of the blackguard. He is a crusader of Tyr who wishes to see Dorn's name in the Scroll of Retribution‚Äîit will give him the strength to slay the monster and redeem his family name.~
@323  = ~Him? That's Dorn Il-Khan.~
@324  = ~Ah yes, I recognize the name now. A planetar recently had Alore inscribe the name in the Scroll of Retribution.~
@325  = ~A terrible person, <CHARNAME>. They shame me.~
@326  = ~You can imagine my dismay to learn that someone was doing such horrible things in my name.~
@327  = ~And rightly so, as you'll soon discover.~
@328  = ~That's the name the planetar had Naiman inscribe on the‚Äî By the gods, you're <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@329  = ~By the gods, you're <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@330  = ~Who would have the audacity‚Äî?~
@331  = ~Good evening to you, Rodesi Ponz.~
@332  = ~I seek the Scribe of Righteous Wrath.~
@333  = ~I hope you're right, but we'll see how good it is shortly.~
@334  = ~I've business in the pavilion. Let me pass.~
@335  = ~A cousin of a half-orc blackguard and a <PRO_MANWOMAN> with the same name as the blackguard's companion. That's quite a coincidence, <CHARNAME>.~
@336  = ~Believe me, I'm well aware of that. Sometimes I wonder which god of mischief I inadvertently wronged to be inflicted with such a namesake.~
@337  = ~Tyr moves in mysterious ways.~
@338  = ~It is, and it's one I've little interest in discussing further. Stand aside.~
@339  = ~The gods are not without a sense of humor, it's true.~
@340  = ~That is not my experience.~
@341  = ~Of course.~
@342  = ~What is your business here?~
@343  = ~I need to speak with the Scribe of Righteous Wrath.~
@344  = ~I have new names that need inclusion in the Scroll of Divine Retribution.~
@345  = ~No business of yours, dwarf.~
@346  = ~No business of yours.~
@347  = ~You would lecture me on my duties, <PRO_RACE>?~
@348  = ~I meant no offense, dwarf. But I am to speak to the scribe, and no one but the scribe.~
@349  = ~I meant no offense. But I am to speak to the scribe, and no one but the scribe.~
@350  = ~Forgive me if I seemed harsh. I can see that you know your duties well and perform them with integrity and poise. I'll leave you to them.~
@351  = ~Stand aside. My business is not with you.~
@352  = ~Really? That's odd.~
@353  = ~How so?~
@354  = ~These are odd times.~
@355  = ~Less odd than one who is inscribed in the Scroll of Retribution infiltrating Lunia and attempting to have their name removed?~
@356  = ~Normally, Alore receives new names from divine inspiration. Occasionally, a planetar will offer an addition, but I can't recall a champion ever doing so.~
@357  = ~ 'Tis an unusual situation, I'll grant you that. But I am helpless before the will of Tyr. Please, let me pass.~
@358  = ~Strictly 'twixt you and me, you can expect more of this sort of thing in the near future. Times are changing, my friend, and not for the better.~
@359  = ~What you recall is of no consequence. Let me through, now.~
@360  = ~True enough. Pass.~
@361  = ~I'll not stand between a champion and their calling. Pass.~
@362  = ~These are dark days, right enough. Pass.~
@363  = ~You are right in that. But something's not right here...~
@364  = ~I can see there'll be no getting past you, O righteous defender. I applaud your diligence and will take my leave of you now.~
@365  = ~You're right about that. You've no idea how right.~
@366  = ~Last chance. Let me through, now.~
@367  = ~Wrong move, <PRO_RACE>.~
@368  = ~You speak well enough, but your words ring false. Something's not right here...~
@369  = ~You're right about that, my friend. These are dark days indeed. I commend you for your vigilance‚ÄîI'll be on my way now.~
@370  = ~I'll grant you it's an unusual situation. But I am helpless before the will of Tyr. Please, let me pass.~
@371  = ~I cannot, not until I'm sure.~
@372  = ~Then I will be on my way.~
@373  = ~You brought this on yourself.~
@374  = ~There's no other kind, here.~
@375  = ~Heh. True enough. I would speak with the person responsible for the Scroll of Retribution.~
@376  = ~You're about to find how wrong you are, fool.~
@377  = ~Feel my wrath, <PRO_RACE>!~
@378  = ~Face the gods' wrath, fiend!~
@379  = ~Only Naiman can cross a name off the Scroll. And then only via divine inspiration. Why are you really here?~
@380  = ~You wouldn't believe me if I told you.~
@381  = ~I was divinely inspired to seek Naiman. Will you truly stand in my way?~
@382  = ~I've received some divine inspiration of my own‚Äîmy god says you must die.~
@383  = ~What is your name, again?~
@384  = ~What business do you have with Alore?~
@385  = ~I've a couple names he can cross off the scroll. I took divine retribution upon them.~
@386  = ~He's my uncle.~
@387  = ~Personal business. Let me pass.~
@388  = ~That would be Naiman.~
@389  = ~Ho there, scribe! This <PRO_RACE> says <PRO_HESHE> has business with you.~
@390  = ~Ho there, scribe! This <PRO_RACE> says you're <PRO_HISHER> uncle!~
@391  = ~Defend yourself, intruder!~
@392  = ~You're going nowhere, <PRO_RACE>. ~
@393  = ~Oh, aye, we've been expecting you.~
@394  = ~Never thought I'd speak with one of the condemned...but there's been a shadow over these proceedings from the start.~
@395  = ~As you near the Scroll of Retribution, you can feel its power rolling over you in waves. The divine wrath it represents is a palpable energy that fills the air of the Pavilion.~
@396  = ~The names of those despised by the gods radiate from the scroll‚Äîyour own among them. In your hand you hold the quill that can see it erased.~
@397  = ~Do you erase your name?~
@398  = ~Do you erase Dorn's name?~
@399  = ~Do you erase your and Dorn's name?~
@400  = ~Your name is no longer written in the Scroll of Retribution. The will of the gods has been defied.~
@401  = ~The air in the pavilion has changed somehow‚Äîyour sacrilege has poisoned it, or so it seems to you. No one else seems to notice.~
@402  = ~With your name removed, there is a space in the scroll in which you could inscribe another.~
@403  = ~Do you inscribe Yaga-Shura's name?~
@404  = ~Do you inscribe Sendai's name?~
@405  = ~Do you inscribe Abazigal's name?~
@406  = ~Do you inscribe Melissan's name?~
@407  = ~Do you inscribe Noober's name?~
@408  = ~Do you inscribe Saemon Havarian's name?~
@409  = ~Do you inscribe Ur-Gothoz's name?~
@410  = ~Do you inscribe Azothet's name?~
@411  = ~Do you leave the Pavilion of Righteous Wrath?~
@412  = ~Dorn's name is no longer written in the Scroll of Retribution. The will of the gods has been defied.~
@413  = ~With Dorn's name removed, there is a space in the scroll in which you could inscribe another.~
@414  = ~Your names are no longer written in the Scroll of Retribution. The will of the gods has been defied.~
@415  = ~With your and Dorn's names removed, there are spaces in the scroll in which you could inscribe others.~
@416  = ~Again, you feel the air itself change as you thwart the will of the gods. Yet another empty space remains in the Scroll of Retribution, and you still hold the quill.~
@417  = ~Dorn's name is still inscribed in the Scroll of Retribution.~
@418  = ~Do you erase the half-orc's name?~
@419  = ~With Dorn's name removed, the scroll has another blank space you could fill... if you dare.~
@420  = ~The name is inscribed, and with it comes the knowledge that you must leave this place immediately. A dark hole is forming in the pit of your stomach as the air around you seems curdle like milk. While no one else seems affected, in every fiber of your being you know that to remain in this place is certain doom.~
@421  = ~Your name is still written in the Scroll of Retribution.~
@422  = ~Do you erase it?~
@423  = ~With your name removed, the scroll has another blank space you could fill... if you dare.~
@424  = ~A good idea, or so you think. Though no one else seems to have noticed, to you the atmosphere in the pavilion has been tainted in some way. It is only a matter of time before someorealizes that all is not right in the sphere of Lunia, and then all eyes will turn to you...~
@425  = ~With the sacred sand entrusted to you, the ink upon the scroll fades, leaving its surface unblemished.~
@426  = ~There is a space in which you could inscribe another name in your stead.~
@427  = ~The air around you curdles like milk, yet no one else seems to notice. Whether doom or deliverance awaits, a new die has been cast.~
@428  = ~You step away in solemn silence, leaving the Scroll in its intended state.~
@429  = ~Have you found the sigil yet?~ [OH89785]
@430  = ~Not yet, no.~
@431  = ~I'm close now. Very close. I can almost taste it.~
@432  = ~When I have it, I'll tell you.~
@433  = ~Then why are you talking to me? Go!~ [OH89786]
@434  = ~Ho there, <PRO_RACE>. Why do you still tarry here?~ [OH89739]
@435  = ~I await Tyr's guidance.~
@436  = ~Tyr has inspired me to go to a place called the Pavilion of Righteous Wrath. Do you know it?~
@437  = ~I do not know when, or if, I shall see this place again. I just want to take it all in.~
@438  = ~That is no business of yours.~
@439  = ~You are wise to do so. Be patient. I am sure he will speak to you soon.~ [OH89740]
@440  = ~Indeed I do. It is a straight line from the gates to the earthly realm, through here, past the Statue of the Sentinel, to the Pavilion. On foot, you'll need to take one of tstairways available yonder. When you see the Sentinel, you'll not have far to go‚Äîits back is to the Pavilion.~ [OH89742]
@441  = ~I thank you.~
@442  = ~Lunia is a wonder. But do not be distracted by its glories‚Äîthere is work to be done in the earthly realms.~ [OH89747]
@443  = ~No business of mine? As a crusader of Tyr, you are mine to command.~ [OH89750]
@444  = ~Forgive me. I spoke in haste.~
@445  = ~No one commands me.~
@446  = ~Next time, think before you speak.~ [OH89752]
@447  = ~I will. Again, my apologies.~
@448  = ~Such behavior is beneath one of your esteemed rank. You are not fit to carry the sigil‚Äîhand it over.~ [OH89754]
@449  = ~No, please, don't make me do that.~
@450  = ~I can't. I lost it.~
@451  = ~The only thing I'll give you is a quick death.~
@452  = ~In time, if you are penitent and humble, you may be redeemed. For the moment, however, I strip you of your rank. Give me your sigil.~ [OH89756]
@453  = ~As you wish.~
@454  = ~I'd really rather not.~
@455  = ~Give me your life, godsucker.~
@456  = ~Go now. Take some time over there at the Constellations to reflect on your sins of pride and arrogance.~ [OH89758]
@457  = ~What?~ [OH89761]
@458  = ~I lost it. That's why I was so curt with you. I was upset and afraid of what might happen if you learned of my mistake.~
@459  = ~Someone stole it. There are unsavory characters around this place.~
@460  = ~It's gone. I don't know how it happened.~
@461  = ~Well, don't just stand around sulking‚Äîfind the sigil. Its value is incalculable!~ [OH89764]
@462  = ~It might save time if I had another sigil‚ÄîI mean, the last thing I need is to waste time explaining who I am to people over and over again.~
@463  = ~I will do that. Thank you, mistress.~
@464  = ~You lost your sigil and ask ME for a replacement?~ [OH89766]
@465  = ~Just a temporary one until I retrieve the original.~
@466  = ~Very well. Here, but I want this back as soon as possible. Now stop wasting time. Go, go!~ [OH89769]
@467  = ~Stop wasting time and GO FIND THE SIGIL!~ [OH89772]
@468  = ~You deny me?~ [OH89775]
@469  = ~Reluctantly, yes.~
@470  = ~Only because you ask for something I do not want to give.~
@471  = ~Yes. How does that make you feel?~
@472  = ~Prepare to feel Tyr's wrath, <PRO_RACE>!~ [OH89784]
@473  = ~You are the few who answered my call. You handful of righteous men and women will enforce the laws of Tyr, carrying out his judgments where other mortal agents fail.~ [OH89695]
@474  = ~This sounds interesting.~
@475  = ~Wait a moment. I would hear this planetar speak.~
@476  = ~The last thing we want to be around is people looking to enforce Tyr's will. Let's move on.~
@477  = ~I answer another call, planetar‚Äîa call for your destruction!~
@478  = ~For each of you, I have a sigil granting permission to enter the White Pavilion.~ [OH89698]
@479  = ~Come now, and receive Tyr's gift.~ [OH89700]
@480  = ~What is your name, Champion of Tyr?~ [OH89701]
@481  = ~I am <CHARNAME>.~
@482  = ~Keldorn Firecam.~
@483  = ~My name is Rodesi Ponz.~
@484  = ~I am your doom, planetar.~
@485  = ~I know that name... But from where...?~ [OH89702]
@486  = ~I could not say.~
@487  = ~You say my deeds in Tyr's service are known even in this elevated place? You honor me, planetar.~
@488  = ~From the Scroll of Retribution, most likely‚ÄîI'll earn my place within it with your annihilation!~
@489  = ~I know this name. But‚Äîyou are a paladin of Torm.~ [OH89703]
@490  = ~That is my father's brother. I was named after him. As much as I respect him, my loyalty is to Tyr.~
@491  = ~Damn. I was hoping you wouldn't catch that.~
@492  = ~No longer. Now, I am your death incarnate.~
@493  = ~You dare threaten a planetar of the Night's Eye Battalion? In Lunia, of all places? You are mad, <PRO_RACE>‚Äîyour destruction will be a mercy.~ [OH89704]
@494  = ~Deceiver! Taste the Maimed God's justice!~ [OH89705]
@495  = ~Your uncle is well known and respected, Firecam. You will make a fine champion for the Just God.~ [OH89706]
@496  = ~Your lies are skilled and graceful, whoever you are. But I'm not deceived. Champions of Tyr! Strike this deceiver down!~ [OH89707]
@497  = ~Take this sigil, Rodesi Ponz. Go forth with Tyr's blessing, and do his work.~ [OH89708]
@498  = ~No... Something in your words rings false.~ [OH89709]
@499  = ~It was recently I heard it‚Äîno, saw it. @191 /* <CHARNAME>. */ Ah. I know it now.~ [OH89710]
@500  = ~Their name is written in the Scroll of Retribution! Champions of Tyr, strike them down, now!~ [OH89711]
@501  = ~Hm, yes. I guess... Take this sigil, <CHARNAME>. Go forth with Tyr's blessing and do his work.~ [OH89712]
@502  = ~Come now and receive Tyr's gift.~ [OH89700]
@503  = ~Speak, <CHARNAME>. What burden weighs upon your soul?~
@504  = ~Did you command Naiman Alore to write down my name?~
@505  = ~Nay, 'twas not I who bade it.~
@506  = ~Should you doubt my word, seek the testimony of those who dwell here. I stand as a sentinel, welcoming neophytes and aiding them in their duties.~
@507  = ~I know this name. But - you are a paladin of Torm.~ [OH89703]
@508  = ~I believe they inquired after your name, not mine. But if names must be shared, then grant me the privilege of introducing you. This is <CHARNAME>, <PRO_HESHE> leads our party with courage and honor.~
@509  = ~I know this name. Your arrival was anticipated. Seek out Naiman Alore, <CHARNAME>. As our scribe, who better to ascertain your guilt than the man who penned it? He awaits you near the Scroll of Retribution.~
@510  = ~My footsteps feel lighter here somehow. Would it be selfish of us to linger for a while?~
@511  = ~I see no purpose to our visit here. 'Tis a refuge for fools who pretend that virtue and justice mean something.~
@512  = ~Just look at this place! Kinda makes you forget we're here to prove our innocence.~
@513  = ~My distant cousin, Wren, once joined some crusade planning to storm the City of Judgment. He ended up in a cabbage market near Thesk shouting about soul taxes instead. Poor lad never could read a map. ...Yes, I'm aware this isn't the same locale. Must all my tales be relevant to the situation at hand?~
@514  = ~Lunia is not without its beauty. A pity that our circumstances offer us little cause to appreciate it.~
@515  = ~So this is Mount Celestia's front step? It's nice. I don't suppose there's a gift shop nearby? We should definitely grab some souvenirs before we leave.~
@516  = ~The White Pavilion welcomes you.~
@517  = ~Wilson.~
@518  = ~*Wilson grunts and scuffles his paws*~
@519  = ~He says you shared your rations with him. ...And let him maul those who would harm others. In bear circles that apparently earns you his respect.~
@520  = ~How did those silver dragon scales come into your keeping?~
@521  = ~Two wyrms of argent hue parted with them willingly, for even dragons shed their loosened scales.~
@522  = ~In return, I offered them gems from the trenches where sunlight never dares to swim. A fair trade, I think. Gleam for gleam, treasure for treasure.~
@523  = ~The drow Solaufein, who dared to show compassion in the blackest depths of the Underdark, was slain by your hand.~
@524  = ~You poisoned a sacred grove, upending the harmony of nature.~

@526  = ~I helped the child Wellyn's spirit find peace.~

@536  = ~If you seek praise then look elsewhere, I won't waste my breath on this testimony.~
@537  = ~Such is your right.~
@538  = ~I once thought compassion a weakness, yet <CHARNAME> has shown me otherwise. Does that not attest to <PRO_HISHER> character?~
@539  = ~To teach another kindness is no small feat. It speaks well of <PRO_HIMHER>.~
