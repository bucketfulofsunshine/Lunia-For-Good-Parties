# Lunia-For-Good-Parties

Lunia's map is a refreshing contrast to the many hellish locales present in Baldur's Gate 2. Unfortunately only parties who travel with Dorn, typically those of neutral-or-evil alignment, gain access to it.

This mod provides an alternate path for Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good & Lawful Neutral characters - with a reputation of 14 or above - to enter Lunia & assist Tyr's faithful in doling out his justice.

## FAQ

### Q: Is this a counterpart to [Fight the Heavens](https://www.morpheus-mart.com/fight-the-heavens)?

A: I wasn't aware of *Fight the Heavens* where I started creating *Lunia For Good Parties*. I feel both mods have their place, as FtH is intended for Evil Parties, & LFGP exists on the opposite spectrum. That said FtH is an excellent mod - so well worth the download - even if both mods aren't viable on the same playthrough. 

### Q: When does the quest start?

A: The quest kicks off when you enter Amkethran. A Planetar of Justice will appear & initiate a dialogue with your party. If you choose to accept, you'll receive a feather that allows you to Plane Shift to Lunia.

### Q: Any known bugs?

A: *Yes*. This literally steals Dorn's TOB quest & alters the content so Lunia can be accessed without him. That means, if you have Dorn in your party, the quest **won't start** even if you otherwise meet the requirements. 

### Q: So would this break custom companion interjections?

A: In theory, no. The vanilla dialogues I use have new branches attached to them. That means you won't see the companion interjections unless they check for these new branches. Any talks that check for the AreaName ("OH5500") will still fire though - and will have tonal discrepancies without crossmod.

### Q: Any future plans?

* Version 1.0 will allow the party to travel to Lunia & complete an altered version of Dorn's questline.
* Version 2.0 will provide compatibility without taking a sledgehammer to the dialogue & area scripts. Aka allow you to install the mod without breaking ALL THE THINGS.

## CHANGELOG

* **20250725 - Alpha**. Nearing full release. Started on sweeping compatiblity updates. Still not content complete (need to finish final dialogues & item descriptions). 

## LICENSING

* This mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests, etc. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. changing what I've written), crossmod is free real estate.

## CREDITS

* *RoyalProtector* for fixing all my coding errors & creating the best new items. <3 
* *Zenblack* for teaching me how to create custom BAM files.
