# Lunia-For-Good-Parties
Lunia's map is a refreshing contrast to the many hellish locales present in Baldur's Gate 2. Unfortunately only parties who travel with Dorn, typically those of neutral-or-evil alignment, gain access to it. 

This mod provides an alternate path for Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good & Lawful Neutral characters - with a reputation of 14 or above - to enter Lunia & assist Tyr's faithful in doling out his justice. 

## FAQ

### Q: When does the quest start? 

A: The quest kicks off when you enter Amkethran. A Planetar of Justice will appear & initiate a dialogue with your party. If you choose to accept, you'll receive a feather that allows you to Plane Shift to Lunia.

### Q: Any known bugs?

A: *Yes*. This literally steals Dorn's TOB quest & alters the content so Lunia can be accessed without him. That means, if you have Dorn in your party, the quest **won't start**. And, if the mod is installed, then Dorn's normal quest won't fuction as intended. *Please* don't install this if you intend to use him as a companion.

### Q: Any future plans?

A: 

* Version 1.0 will allow the party to travel to Lunia & complete an altered version of Dorn's questline. 
* Version 2.0 will provide compatibility without taking a sledgehammer to the dialogue & area scripts. Aka allow you to install the mod without breaking Dorn in TOB. 

## CHANGELOG

* **20250718 - Alpha**. The altered questline isn't fully implemented. Several dialogues still need adjustments & the new enemies haven't been added.

## LICENSING
* This mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests, etc. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. changing what I've written), crossmod is free real estate.
