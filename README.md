# Lunia-For-Good-Parties
Lunia's map is a refreshing contrast to the many hellish locales present in Baldur's Gate 2. Unfortunately only parties who travel with Dorn, typically those of neutral-or-evil alignment, gain access to it. 

This mod provides an alternate path for Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good & Lawful Neutral characters - with a reputation of 14 or above - to enter Lunia & assist Tyr's faithful in doling out his justice. 

## FAQ

### Q: Is this a counterpart to [Fight the Heavens](https://www.morpheus-mart.com/fight-the-heavens)?

A: I wasn't aware of *Fight the Heavens* where I started creating *Lunia For Good Parties*. I feel both mods have their place, as FtH is intended for Evil Parties, & LFGP exists on the opposite spectrum. At present these mods are not compatible since I override essential scripts. After LFGP V2.0 drops they can both be installed but won't be viable on the same playthrough. That said FtH is an excellent mod - so well worth the download. 

### Q: When does the quest start? 

A: The quest kicks off when you enter Amkethran. A Planetar of Justice will appear & initiate a dialogue with your party. If you choose to accept, you'll receive a feather that allows you to Plane Shift to Lunia.

### Q: Any known bugs?

A: *Yes*. This literally steals Dorn's TOB quest & alters the content so Lunia can be accessed without him. That means, if you have Dorn in your party, the quest **won't start**. And, if the mod is installed, then Dorn's normal quest won't function as intended. *Please* don't install this if you intend to use him as a companion.

### Q: So would this break custom companion interjections?

A: In theory no. The vanilla talks I bypass have new file names. That means you won't see the companion interjections at all. Any talks that fire when checking for the AreaName ("OH5500") will still fire though. And will have tonal discrepancies. All of this will cease being a problem in V2.0 since I'll be renaming both the area & all the scripts / characters I use. 

### Q: Any future plans?

* Version 1.0 will allow the party to travel to Lunia & complete an altered version of Dorn's questline. 
* Version 2.0 will provide compatibility without taking a sledgehammer to the dialogue & area scripts. Aka allow you to install the mod without breaking ALL THE THINGS.

## CHANGELOG

* **20250723 - Alpha**. Nearing full release. Mercy Whitedove & final conversation adjustments (+enemies) still have to be added.

## LICENSING
* This mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests, etc. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. changing what I've written), crossmod is free real estate.
