# Lunia-For-Good-Parties
Allows Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good & Lawful Neutral characters, that have a reputation of 14 or above, to travel to Lunia. 

## FAQ

### Q: When do I start the quest? 

A: Upon entering Amkethran: a Planetar of Justice will spawn & start a dialogue. If you accept the quest, then the party will receive a feather & can use it to Plane Shift. 

### Q: Any known bugs?

A: Yes. This literally steals Dorn's TOB quest & alters the content so Lunia functions without his presence. That means, if you have Dorn in the party, the quest **will not work**. And, if you have the mod installed, then the vanilla quest for Dorn won't function as intended. *Please* only install this mod if you don't plan to have him as a companion. Otherwise wait for a future version with better compatiblity. 

### Q: Any future plans?

A: Version 1.0 will allow the party to travel to Lunia & complete an altered version of Dorn's quest. For Version 2.0+ I intend to add sidequests that explore Lunia further (e.g. have the party partake in bounties to track down criminals, offer a path to further empower any weapon that has the Eye of Tyr upgrade, etc). 

## CHANGELOG

* **20250718 - Alpha**. I still need to alter several dialogues & actually test then upload the mod. 

## LICENSING
* This mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests, etc. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. changing what I've written), crossmod is free real estate.
