![A map of Lunia, the area from Dorn's TOB quest](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/baldursgategame/images/5/5a/Lunia_BG2EE.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20220129201030)

# Lunia For Good Parties (for BG2EE or EET)

Lunia's map is a refreshing contrast to the many hellish locales present in Baldur's Gate II. Unfortunately only parties who travel with Dorn - typically those of neutral or evil alignment - gain access to it.

This quest mod provides an alternate path for Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good & Lawful Neutral characters (with a reputation of 14 or higher) to enter Lunia & assist Tyr's faithful in doling out his justice.

**V1.3 adds** 
- A rewritten questline where the player has to get their name removed from the Scroll of Retribution.
- A short conversation-based sidequest with a malfunctioning Inevitable.
- A merchant with a few unique items.

**V2.0 will add**
- Pick up two bounties from Mercy Whitedove & assist Tyr's faithful in further hunting down the wicked.
- Stop invaders from burning down the Silver Apple Tree while they're invading Lunia.

## FAQ

### Q: Is this a counterpart to [Fight the Heavens](https://www.morpheus-mart.com/fight-the-heavens)?

A: I wasn't aware of *Fight the Heavens* when I started creating *Lunia For Good Parties*. I feel both mods have their place: FtH is intended for evil parties, while LFGP exists on the opposite spectrum. That said FtH is an excellent mod - well worth the download - even if both mods aren't viable on the same playthrough. If you want to install both, install Lunia before Fight the Heavens, & install that later to have priority. 

### Q: When does the quest start?

A: The quest kicks off when you enter Amkethran. A Planetar of Justice will appear & initiate a dialogue with your party. If you choose to accept the mission, you'll receive a feather that allows you to Plane Shift to Lunia.

### Q: Any other important notes?

A: *Yes*. This mod literally steals Dorn's TOB quest & alters it so Lunia can be accessed without him. That means, if you have Dorn in your party, LFGP **won't start** even if you otherwise meet the requirements. 

### Q: Will this break custom companion interjections?

A: No. The vanilla dialogues I use have new branches attached to them. That means you won't see interjections unless they check for these new branches. Any talks that check for the AreaName ("OH5500") will still fire though - but may have tonal discrepancies without crossmod content.

## CHANGELOG

* **20250914** - V1.3 Release. 
* **20260215** - V1.3.1 Release. 

## LICENSING

* This mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests, etc. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. changing what I've written), crossmod is free real estate.
